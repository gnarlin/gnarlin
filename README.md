- 👋 Hi, I’m @gnarlin
- 👀 I’m interested in bash scripting and Free software in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently writing something which I will no doubt not look at again for serveral years, if ever, and it would therefore be silly to write any fleeting
interests that my might be passing through my frontal cortex these days.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my little project, Osget, which is an operating system ISO downloader for the terminal. Think of it like a package manager but
for operating system image files (ISO's). I need help adding more operating system to the oslist repository. Just read the config files. They are absurdly easy
to replicate for other operating systems.
- 📫 You can reach me at gnarlin@fripost and on Twitter @gnarlin2
